## Abstract

Pandemics are outbreaks of an infectious disease that increase morbidity
and mortality over a wide geographic area. These events require
large-scale interventions from governments and health agencies to
curtail transmission within a population. In assessing the impact of
these interventions, policymakers avail themselves of simulations from
compartmental models. However, it is commonplace that modellers employ
fixed fractions to represent interventions, which implicitly assume that
resources instantaneously and boundlessly adjust to the desired target
and may predict overly optimistic outcomes. Here, we propose a model
that integrates four crucial countermeasures subject to resource
constraints. We present this structure utilising the concept of small
models and frame the simulations in the context of a hypothetical spread
of influenza in the Netherlands, drawing on empirical data. After
incorporating resource constraints, we find that only a comprehensive
response controls the disease. These findings highlight the need for
improving strategic plans to support pandemic preparedness.
